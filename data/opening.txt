You'll find the following files:

fen.doc
long001.idx
eco000.idx
nic000.idx
changes.txt

long.idx is standard English long name
eco.idx is the ECO classification scheme
nic.idx is the NIC classification scheme

Current features:

Include color reversed positions (tagged with a *).

Please do not modify any of these files and then distribute, since I do
not want multiple versions of these floating around and confusing people.
If there is something you'd like to see added or changed, please contact
me so we can do it together and keep everything coherent.  The next
versions planned will hopefully feature *much* greater compression of data,
and the abilility to recognize a transposition out of one main line and
into another (there is a difference between very early positions and deep
main lines).
